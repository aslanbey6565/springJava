        What are the differences between "abstract class" and "Interface"
        1) Methods: i) "abstract class can have both abstract and concrete methods
                      "Interfaces can have just abstract methods
                       Note: We can create methods with body by using default and static keywords
                    ii)Methods in abstract class can use any access modifier
                       Methods in interfaces are definetly public
         2) Variables : i) abstract class can have every type of variables
                        interfaces can have just public, static and final variables
                        Note: Variables may or may not be final in interface because of that it is not mandatory to initialize
         3) Note: By the help of the interfaces we can create multible parents for a class but
         when we use abstract classes it is imposible to create multible parents for a class
         4) Class extends class, interface extends Interface, class implements Interface, Interface cannot be te child of a class



               Question: What do you do to store unique elements in natural order?
                  I use TreeSet
               Question: As you know TreeSet is so slow in adding and removing elements, what do you do to make it fast?
                   i)Create a HashSet
                  ii)Add the elements into HashSet
                  iii)Convert HashSet to TreeSet
